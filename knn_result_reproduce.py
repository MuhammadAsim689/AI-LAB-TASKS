# Import libraries
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Step 1: Load dataset
data = load_iris()               # Load the Iris dataset
X = data.data                    # Features (inputs)
y = data.target                  # Labels (outputs)

# Step 2: Split data into training and testing sets (80% train, 20% test)
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    X, y, test_size=0.2 ,random_state=25
)

# Step 3: Create KNN model with k=3
model = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=5)

# Step 4: Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Step 5: Predict on both training and test data
y_train_pred = model.predict(X_train)   # Predictions for training data
y_test_pred = model.predict(X_test)     # Predictions for test data

# Step 6: Evaluate accuracy for both
train_accuracy = accuracy_score(y_train, y_train_pred)
test_accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_test_pred)

# Step 7: Print the results
print("Training Accuracy:", train_accuracy)
print("Testing Accuracy:", test_accuracy)
